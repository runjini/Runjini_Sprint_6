# Preliminary Hypotheses and Findings: Facebook Campaigns

**Author:** Runjini Murthy

**_Project Description:_** The goal of this project was to assess a set of Facebook ad campaign data, and begin to make hypotheses about the results based on the factors our business is ale to control (namely, spend). Plots were used to identify visual patterns, and correlation coefficients further verified what the eye observed. The impact of spend was not uniform against all possible results, and some types of ads seemed to respond more to spend than others. Further analysis would be needed to validate this finding.

The data file is not publicly accessible as it is private company data, but a sample set is provided that should allow for most of the script work (although the numbers have been changed).

_Next Steps_ I think more work remains in the realm of validating statistical significance, as well as diving deeper into the correlation coefficients observed. Are they truly meaningful?

This data set focused solely on paid ad campaigns; it might be interesting to incorporate organic data and measure the true impact of spend against a placebo group where no or limited spend is used.

One future topic for explorations is creating an experimental design to measure the results based on optimizing the budget, rather than analyzing the results after the fact.
